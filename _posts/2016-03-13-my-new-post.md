Amplify for Jekyll. A Jekyll html theme in the vague style of Medium.com built using Google AMP

Google's Accelerated Mobile Pages Project (a.k.a. "Google AMP" or Google âš¡) is an open-source project that defines rules for creating websites that load nearly instantly even on mobile devices with slow connections.

There are two reasons to use Google AMP:

First, it's really fast! An often cited claim (by Amazon, Yahoo, Walmart and others) is that every extra 100ms improvement in page load time increases incremental revenue by up to 1%. Your personal blog might not be selling anything, but why settle for a slow page and risk losing readers?

Second, Google might feature your AMP page in Search Results! Google gives preferential treatment to AMP pages on Mobile Search. When it displays your page in the AMP search results widget, it will even serve your page through it's own CDN to make the page load even faster. It's similar to how Facebook Instant Articles works on the Facebook platform.

The blog posts are commited to Git and pushed to Netlify. Netlify builds, deploys and hosts your front end.
You can easily use your own domain for a Netlify site. Like I have done for blog.jossang.eu
